## Abstract
<p text-align="left">
EcoTrackr is a web-based carbon footprint tracking platform designed to empower individuals to monitor, analyze, and reduce their daily carbon emissions. By logging everyday activities such as transportation, electricity consumption, and dietary choices, users gain real-time insights into their CO₂ output along with personalized sustainability recommendations.
The system dynamically compares emissions across consecutive days, rewarding users with points for reduced emissions and deducting points when emissions increase. These accumulated points can be redeemed at partnered eco-friendly stores or through collaborations with NGOs, promoting sustainable living through tangible incentives.
Beyond individual tracking, EcoTrackr enables event organizers to host eco-awareness programs and provides NGOs with a platform to showcase sustainable products. Through its interactive dashboard, carbon analytics, and gamified reward system, EcoTrackr transforms environmental awareness into measurable, actionable change—fostering a culture of responsibility, community participation, and greener living.

## Requirements
|||
|--|--|
| Node.js | >= 18.0.0 (for backend server) |
| MongoDB | >= 4.4 (for database) |
| Modern Browser | Chrome, Firefox, Edge — latest stable |

## Installation and usage

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AAC-Open-Source-Pool/25AACR18.git

# Move into the project folder (the repo's working directory)
cd ecotrack

# Install dependencies listed in package.json so the project can build and run
npm install

# Create a local environment file from the example (stores secrets and configuration)
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your configuration
# Open .env in a text editor and set values like DB connection string, PORT, API keys, and any other variables required by the app
# Make sure you do NOT commit real secrets to git; use safe values for local development
# Example: set MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ecotrack and PORT=5000 if those are expected
# Save the file after updating the variables.

# Start MongoDB (make sure it's running)
# If you have MongoDB installed locally, run mongod in a separate terminal to start the database process.
# Alternatively, if you use a cloud MongoDB (Atlas), ensure the MONGO_URI in .env points to it and that network access is allowed.
mongod

# Start the development server
# This runs the backend and/or frontend dev script defined in package.json (e.g. starts Node/Express and Vite/React dev servers)
npm run dev

# Access the application
# Frontend: http://localhost:5173
# Open this URL in your browser to view the client-side UI (usually served by Vite or similar dev server).
# Backend API: http://localhost:5000
# The backend REST endpoints (Express) will typically be available here for API requests; use Postman or browser to test routes.
